## About

My name is Alisha Nanda and I am a sophomore at University of California, Davis. I am currently researching with a professor in the College of Engineering to build a website that provides an adaptive computer science education to users. It is essentially a program that tracks users' weakest and strongest points and uses these to provide better problems. 

I am actively seeking internships for the summer of 2018. Please take a look at my resume and feel free to reach out to me!
